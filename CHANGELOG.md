## [0.2.0] - 2024-12-28

### Refactoring Code for Microservices
Refactored the code for microservices to follow a decoupled architecture and separate front-end/back-end UI as depicted in the new diagram.

### Key Updates

#### Updated Microservice Architecture
- ✔️ Defined roles for `clinicalExtractor`, `AgenticRag`, and `autoDetermination` microservices.
- ✔️ Ensured that each service operates independently with its own configuration files (`run.py`, `settings.yaml`, `evals.py`) and manages specific stages of the processing flow.

#### Enhanced `AgenticRag` Module
- ✔️ Integrated evaluation using LLM to improve accuracy.
- ✔️ Implemented retry logic for retrieval to enhance reliability.

#### FastAPI Integration
- ✔️ Consolidated the FastAPI layer to serve as the main backend interaction point.
- ✔️ Streamlined the `run()` calls to orchestrate processing across the microservices efficiently.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-01-10

### FastAPI Deployment Strategy

- 🔜 Deployment strategy for FastAPI backend using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or containerized applications.
- 🔜 Finalized deployment of the Streamlit UI integration.

### Streamlit Frontend
- 🔜 Enhanced the Streamlit UI to reflect all stages of the processing flow, providing clear, real-time feedback to users.
- 🔜 Integrated proper HTTP POST request handling for seamless backend communication and dynamic response updates.

### AI Gateway & Infra Layer Updates
- 🔜  Leveraged the AI Gateway (APIM) for secure and efficient routing to Azure OpenAI and other AI services.
- 🔜  Ensured Azure components are used optimally to deliver scalable and robust processing solutions.

### CI/CD Integration
