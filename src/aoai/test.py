This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on MRD response rate and hematological relapse-free survival. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.\n\n· Relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL\n\no Treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adults and children.\n :unselected:\nPolicy/Criteria\n\nProvider must submit documentation (such as office chart notes, lab results or other clinical information) supporting that member has met all approval criteria.\n\nIt is the policy of health plans affiliated with Envolve Pharmacy Solutions™ that Blincyto is medically necessary when the following criteria are met:\n\nI. Initial Approval Criteria\n\nA. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (must meet all):\n\n1\\. Diagnosis of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL);\n\n2\\. Prescribed by or in consultation with an oncologist or hematologist;\n\n3\\. Requested as treatment for (a or b):\n\na. B-ALL in remission but positive for minimal residual disease (MRD+);\n\nb. Relapsed or refractory B-ALL (i and ii):\n\ni. Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) disease;\n\nii. Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) disease and intolerant or refractory to at least one second-generation or later tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI; i.e., Sprycel®, Tasigna®, Bosulif®, Iclusig®);\n\n\\*Prior authorization is (or may be) required for these agents\n\n4\\.

Appendices/General Information\n\nAppendix A: Abbreviation/Acronym Key B-ALL: B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia CR: complete remission\n\nFDA: Food and Drug Administration MRD+: positive minimal residual disease TKI: tyrosine kinase inhibitor\n\nAppendix B: Therapeutic Alternatives This table provides a listing of preferred alternative therapy recommended in the approval criteria. The drugs listed here may not be a formulary agent and may require prior authorization.\n\n| Drug Name | Dosing Regimen | Dose Limit/ Maximum Dose |\n| - | - | - |\n| Sprycel® (dasatinib) | 140 mg PO QD (adults\\*) | 180 mg/day |\n| Iclusig® (ponatinib) | 45 mg PO QD (adults\\*) | 45 mg/day |\n| Tasigna® (nilotinib) | 400 mg PO BID (off-label use; adults\\* - as referenced in Kim, et al., 2015; see also Appendix D) | 800 mg/day |\n| Bosulif® (bosutinib) | 500 to 600 mg PO QD (off-label use; adults\\* - as referenced in Gambacroti-Passerini, et al., 2015; see also Appendix D). | 600 mg/day |\n\nTherapeutic alternatives are listed as Brand name® (generic) when the drug is available by brand name only and generic (Brand name®) when the drug is available by both brand and generic.\n\n\\*Sprycel and Iclusig are FDA approved for Ph+ ALL in adults; however, all four listed TKIs are NCCN recommended (category 2A) for Ph+ ALL in both adults and adolescents/young adults.\n\nAppendix C: Contraindications Not applicable\n\nAppendix D: General Information\n\n. MRD-positive B-cell precursor ALL\n\nIn 2018, Blincyto received FDA approval for MRD+ B-ALL in remission based on a single- o arm, open label study (BLAST) showing complete MRD response in a majority of adults undergoing Blincyto therapy; the new FDA indication includes both children and adults based on this pivotal trial.\n\no In 2017, blinatumomab\'s labeled use was expanded from treatment of Ph- relapsed/refractory • Relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL\n\nB-ALL to treatment of Ph+ disease based on a single-arm, open label study (ALCANTARAA) showing complete remission (CR), or CR with partial hematologic recovery, after disease progression on at least one second- or thid-generation TKI. FDA approved second- and third- generation TKIs for Ph+ ALL in adults include Sprycel and Iclusig. NCCN recommended (category 2A) TKIs for Ph+ ALL in adults and adolescents/young adults include Sprycel, Iclusig, Tasigna and Bosulif.\n\n<!-- PageNumber="Page 2 of 4" -->\n\nCLINICAL POLICY Blinatumomab\n\n<figure>\n\n![](figures/2)\n\n<!-- FigureContent="envolve Pharmacy Solutions TM" -->\n\n</figure>\n\n\n\n# V.
