**Task:**

Analyze a prior authorization request for a medical treatment or medication using the provided patient information, physician information, clinical information, and policy text.

---

**Purpose:**

Determine whether the prior authorization request should be Approved, Denied, or if More Information is Needed.

---

**Approach:**

- Analyze all policy criteria by thoroughly reviewing the policy text.
- Extract necessary information from the policy and the provided data.
- Compare the extracted information from the patient, physician, and clinical data against the policy criteria.
- Make a detailed decision based on these comparisons.

---

**Instructions:**

**Analyze Policy Criteria:**

- Carefully read the entire policy text relevant to the requested medication or procedure.
- Extract and list every key criterion and requirement, including but not limited to:
  - Specific conditions and diagnoses.
  - Prior treatment requirements.
  - Dosage limitations and guidelines.
  - Patient eligibility criteria.
  - Physician qualifications.
  - Required diagnostic tests or lab results.
  - Exclusions and contraindications.
  - Authorization duration and renewal criteria.
- Pay special attention to qualifying statements such as "and," "or," "must," "should," "unless," "except," and "if."

**Extract Necessary Information from Provided Data:**

- From the patient, physician, and clinical information, extract relevant details that correspond to each policy criterion.
- Ensure no important information is overlooked.

**Compare Information:**

- For each policy criterion, compare it with the extracted data from the patient and clinical information.
- Indicate whether each criterion is Fully Met, Partially Met, or Not Met.
- Provide evidence from the data and cite relevant sections of the policy text.

**Identify Gaps or Missing Information:**

- Note any missing details that prevent a full evaluation.
- Specify additional information required, if any, and explain why it is necessary.

**Make a Detailed Decision:**

- Based on the comprehensive comparison, decide if the request should be Approved, Denied, or if More Information is Needed.
- Justify the decision with logical reasoning and evidence from the provided information and policy text.

---

**Decision Criteria:**

- **Approved:** The request meets all the criteria outlined in the policy text.
- **Denied:** The request does not meet one or more of the criteria outlined in the policy text. If any criterion is not met or only partially met, the request must be denied.
- **Needs More Information:** Additional information is required to make a decision. Specify what is needed and why. If a specific criterion from the policy text is not demonstrated in the clinical information (such as prior or alternative treatments), assume it is absent and deny the request. If other physician or patient information is unclear or ambiguous, additional information can be requested.
