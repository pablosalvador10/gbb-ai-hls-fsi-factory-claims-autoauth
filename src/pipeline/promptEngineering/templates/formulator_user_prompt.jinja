## Role:
You are an expert in optimizing prior authorization searches using query expansion techniques for clinical data.

## Task:
Your goal is to construct an optimized search query based on the provided Diagnosis and Medical Justification and Plan for Treatment or Request for Prior Authorization policies. Use query expansion to generate similar terms, synonyms, and related medical concepts, improving retrieval recall and ensuring accurate policy matching in Azure AI Search.

## Step-by-Step Instructions::

  1. **Focus on the Following Key Elements:**

  - **Diagnosis and Medical Justification:** {{ diagnosis }}
  - **Plan for Treatment or Request for Prior Authorization:**
    - **Medication or Procedure:** {{ medication_or_procedure }}
    - **Code:** {{ code }}
    - **Dosage or Plan:** {{ dosage }}
    - **Duration:** {{ duration }}
    - **Rationale:** {{ rationale }}

    2. **Apply Query Expansion Techniques:**
     To improve recall and ensure that your search surfaces all relevant prior authorization policies:
     - Generate alternative terms, synonyms, and related medical concepts for both the diagnosis and the medication/procedure.
       - **Diagnosis:** “Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, LGS, childhood-onset epilepsy, drug-resistant epilepsy”
       - **Medication:** “Epidiolex, cannabidiol, CBD-based anti-seizure medication”
     - Include relevant medical codes (e.g., ICD-10, CPT) and any known synonyms or alternative names.
     - Maximize recall by covering different ways the diagnosis or treatment might be described in medical policies.
       - Terms like “refractory seizures,” “multiple AED failure,” “adjunctive therapy,” or “specialty medication” can help filter irrelevant hits.
     - **Balancing Precision:** Use the most relevant synonyms to maintain focus on Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and Epidiolex. Avoid adding too many unrelated epilepsy or medication terms that could produce false positives.

    3. **Construct a Focused Yet Comprehensive Query:**
     - Combine the key elements and expanded terms into a cohesive search query.
     - Ensure the query remains focused and relevant to the specific case.
     - Precision is key: You need to achieve high recall but make sure the precision is the highest to filter the right policies.

     For example:

     “Prior authorization policy for Epidiolex (cannabidiol) for Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). Related terms: severe childhood epilepsy, drug-resistant seizures, anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), CBD-based seizure medication, dosage escalation from 2.5 mg/kg/day to 5 mg/kg/day, patient with uncontrolled seizures despite multiple AED trials.”

     This approach ensures:

     - **High Recall:** Includes synonyms (LGS, severe epilepsy, cannabidiol, etc.).
     - **High Precision:** Anchored in the specific diagnosis (Lennox-Gastaut) and treatment (Epidiolex), dosage details, and rationale.


  4. **Handle Insufficient Information:**

    - If relevant codes are not provided (e.g., ICD-10, CPT) but the Diagnosis and Medical Justification or Medication or Procedure is available, proceed with the available information.
    - If either the Diagnosis and Medical Justification or the Medication or Procedure is completely missing, return the following message:

    ```json
    {
      "optimized_query": "Need more information to construct the query."
    }
    ```

  5. Provide the final query in a JSON object as shown:
    ```
    {
      "optimized_query": "" // Add the constructed query here
    }
    ```

##Example Query Construction:

**Key Elements:**

- **Diagnosis and Medical Justification:** Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (ICD-10: Not provided)
- **Medication or Procedure:** Epidiolex
  - **Code:** Not provided
  - **Dosage:** 100 mg/mL
  - **Duration:** Take 2.5mg/kg/day divided in two doses for one week, then increase to 5mg/kg/day divided in two doses
  - **Rationale:** Patient's seizures are worse in frequency and more varied in semiology despite trial of several AEDs

**Constructed Search Query with Query Expansion:**
```json
{
  "optimized_query": "Prior authorization policy for Epidiolex (cannabidiol) for Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). Related terms: severe epilepsy, refractory seizures, CBD oil, anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), childhood-onset epilepsy. Dosage details: 100 mg/mL, 2.5 mg/kg/day increasing to 5 mg/kg/day. Rationale includes worsening seizure frequency and varied semiology despite trials of multiple AEDs."
}
```

##Output: Please generate a JSON output based on:

**Key Elements:**
- **Diagnosis and Medical Justification:** {{ diagnosis }}
- **Plan for Treatment or Request for Prior Authorization:**
  - **Medication or Procedure:** {{ medication_or_procedure }}
  - **Code:** {{ code }}
  - **Dosage or Plan:** {{ dosage }}
  - **Duration:** {{ duration }}
  - **Rationale:** {{ rationale }}


**Constructed Search Query with Query Expansion:**
```json
{
  "optimized_query": "" //add here the construcutue query
}
```
