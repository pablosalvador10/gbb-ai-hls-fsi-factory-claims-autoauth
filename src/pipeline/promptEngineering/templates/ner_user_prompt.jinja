  }
}

5. **Prior or Historical Treatments**:
    - Ensure that all prior medication names and procedures have been identified.
    - Identify checked boxes and yes or no questions regarding past or historical treatments on the prior authorization request form.
    - List all prior medications and treatments the patient has tried including: drug names, medication class or generation, duration of therapy, number of medications tried (paying close attention to the medication class)

    - If multiple diagnoses, treatments, or lab results are present, list each entry separated by semicolons within the same field.

7. **ICD-10 Codes**:
    - Ensure that any ICD-10 codes are accurately extracted and correspond correctly to the diagnosis.
    - If the ICD-10 code is missing but the diagnosis is present, you may look up the standard ICD-10 code that matches the diagnosis, if appropriate.

8. **Lab Results and Imaging**:
    - Include key findings, values, and any notable abnormalities.
    - Mention the type of test and the date if available.

9. **Symptom Severity and Impact**:

    - State the dosage or plan for the medication or procedure.
    - Specify the duration of doses or days of treatment.
    - Provide the rationale for the medication or procedure based on the clinical information provided.
    - Indicate the presumed eligibility for the medication based on answers to the PA form questions.

**Notes:**
    - Ensure all details are correctly interpreted and accurately transcribed, this is a complex authorization process requiring clinical knowledge.
    - Pay close attention to medical terminology, codes, and any indications of urgency or severity.
    - Pay close attention to specific alternative or prior drugs taken including duration of therapy, class of medication (first or second generation) and the number of prior drugs already used.
    - Be careful extracting checked box responses on forms while doing OCR in the PA forms.
