# üîç The Industry Problem, Challenges & Opportunities

Prior Authorization (PA) serves as a critical checkpoint before delivering certain healthcare treatments. Despite its importance, today‚Äôs PA processes are plagued by delays, manual reviews, and costly inefficiencies.

## Key Pain Points

### Providers
- **41 Requests per Week:** Physicians handle an average of 41 PA requests per week, consuming around 13 hours‚Äîequivalent to two business days.
- **High Administrative Burden:** 88% of physicians report a high or extremely high administrative burden due to PA processes.
- **Treatment Delays:** 93% of physicians report that PA delays access to necessary care, leading to treatment abandonment in 82% of cases.
- **Mortality Risk:** Even a one-week delay in critical treatments like cancer increases mortality risk by 1.2‚Äì3.2%.

### Payors
- **Manual Processing Costs:** Up to 75% of PA tasks remain manual, costing around $3.14 per request.
- **High-Volume Approvals:** Payors face challenges in automating low-risk cases, often leading to bottlenecks in processing.
- **Reduced Accuracy:** Manual errors can result in up to 75% inaccuracies in approval decisions, increasing provider frustration and potential compliance risks.

### Patients
- **Negative Health Outcomes:** Delayed care significantly affects patients, especially in critical care scenarios like oncology, where even slight delays worsen outcomes.
- **Treatment Abandonment:** Long wait times discourage patients, leading to dropped care and increased long-term healthcare costs.

## Regulatory and Industry Trends

### CMS 2026 Regulations
- **Mandated Real-Time Data Exchange:** Payors are required to use APIs based on HL7 FHIR standards to facilitate quicker PA decisions‚Äî72 hours for urgent cases and 7 days for standard requests.
- **Transparency Requirements:** Payors must now provide detailed explanations for PA decisions, fostering trust between providers and payors while ensuring compliance.

### The Push for Automation
- **Demand for AI Integration:** Automation technologies like AI/ML are gaining momentum, promising to reduce manual efforts, improve approval accuracy, and cut costs significantly.
- **FHIR-Driven Interoperability:** Healthcare IT systems are rapidly adopting the FHIR standard, enabling seamless data sharing and decision-making.

## Challenges Highlighted

1. **Operational Inefficiencies**:
    - Providers often lack real-time insight into PA requirements.
    - Transparency issues result in delays and bottlenecks.

2. **Cost and Time Concerns**:
    - Payors spend up to $3.14 per manual transaction.
    - AI-enabled systems can cut costs by 40%, reduce manual effort, and improve decision-making speeds from days to hours.

3. **Patient Risks**:
    - Delayed treatment exacerbates conditions, leading to poor health outcomes.
    - Automation can enhance access and patient satisfaction by reducing turnaround time.

## Automation and Opportunities

By leveraging **AI-driven automation**, PA processes can be streamlined with the following benefits:

1. **40% Reduction in Processing Costs**: AI-enabled auto-approval mechanisms drastically reduce costs in high-volume cases.
2. **Enhanced Provider-Payor Communication**: Transparent, real-time decision-making builds trust and efficiency.
3. **Improved Patient Outcomes**: Faster PA approvals ensure timely care delivery, reducing mortality risks and abandonment rates.
